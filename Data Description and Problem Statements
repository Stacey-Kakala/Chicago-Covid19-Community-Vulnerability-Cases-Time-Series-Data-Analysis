Data Description
I. Data overview - Original data output
Dataset is gathered from the Chicago Data Portal with a focus on COVID-19 occurrences, examinations, fatalities, and associated metrics at the ZIP code scale. 
The complete dataset comprises 12,357 rows and 21 columns.

II. Column definitions:
→ Zip Code: Home ZIP Code of cases and people tested.
→ Week Number: Sequential count of weeks, starting at the beginning of 2020. 
→ Week Start: First date of the week.
→ Week End: Last date of the week.
→ Cases - Weekly: Number of cases in the week. 
→ Case Rate - Weekly: Case rate per 100,000 population in the week.
→ Case Rate - Cumulative: Total case rate per 100,000 population through the week. 
→ Tests - Weekly: Number of tests in the week.
→ Tests - Cumulative: Total number of tests through the week.
→ Test Rate - Weekly: Test rate per 100,000 population in the week. 
→ Percent Tested Positive - Weekly: Percentage of positive test results in the week based on
     specimen collection date. (This rate is a high-end estimate, true rate may be lower.)
→ Percent Tested Positive - Cumulative: Percentage of positive test results through the week    
     based on specimen collection date. (This rate is a high-end estimate, true rate may be lower.)
→ Deaths - Weekly: Number of deaths in the week.
→ Deaths - Cumulative: Total number of deaths through the week.
→ Death Rate - Weekly: Death rate per 100,000 population in the week.
→ Death Rate - Cumulative: Death rate per 100,000 population through the week.
→ Population - Population by ZIP Codes.
→ Row ID
→ ZIP Code Location - Precise point within ZIP Code locations.

III. Key Questions for Analysis:
1.	How do COVID-19 case rates vary across different ZIP codes within Chicago, and what are the actual and potential factors that contribute to these disparities? (e.g. Access to healthcare, Population density, Mobility, Social activities)
2.	Is there a correlation between COVID-19 test, case, and death rates?
3.	Are there any temporal trends observed in COVID-19 cases, tests, and deaths? What are the potential factors?
4.	What strategies can be implemented to address disparities in COVID-19 outcomes among underserved communities in Chicago?
5.	What proactive measures and contingency plans can be developed to better prepare Chicago for future unforeseen circumstances, such as new variants, pandemics, or public health emergencies.
IV. To answer these questions, our areas of interest will be:
•	Case, Test, and Death Rates: We will analyze the total case, test, and death rates in each ZIP code to identify areas with higher case incidence, assess testing coverage and accessibility, and understand the severity of the pandemic's impact on different communities.
•	Population by ZIP codes: Population data associated with each ZIP code will be considered to contextualize COVID-19 metrics and discover variations in population size and density.
•	Correlations and changes in tests, case, and death rates over time: Examining how these rates vary by the year and quarters can uncover societal, epidemiological, or public health factors.
