1. Univariate Analysis
i) Total test rates by ZIP Code – Bar Chart: 
The bar chart vividly portrays the variation in COVID-19 test rates across different ZIP codes within Chicago. The greener shades of the bars on the left indicate regions with higher testing rates such as: 60604 – northeast Illinois and 60601 - West Loop and Union Station area, suggesting potential factors such as increased testing access or greater demand for testing in those areas. In contrast, the yellowish to warmer hues of the bars on the right signify regions with lower testing rates: 60666 - Chicago O’Hare area and 60827 - Riverdale area, which may be indicative of reduced testing access or lower COVID-19 prevalence due to underlying factors such as population which will be examined in subsequent sections.
These disparities in testing rates underscore the importance of understanding the distribution of testing resources and their impact on communities. By identifying areas with lower testing rates, we can assist in targeting interventions and allocate resources more effectively to ensure equitable access to testing and improve public health outcomes across all ZIP codes within Chicago. This analysis highlights the need for ongoing evaluation and adjustment of testing strategies to address the evolving needs of diverse communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. As analyzed in the bar chart, the following filled map generated with PowerBI suggests that these areas stand out as having a substantial number of tests: 60604, and 60601 - West Loop and Union Station area. And in contrast, these ZIP Codes exhibit the lowest testing rates: 60666 - Chicago O’Hare area and 60827 - Riverdale area.
 
ii) Total case rates by ZIP Code – Bar Chart: Figure 4 presents the total COVID-19 case rates by ZIP code, aiming to provide insights into the distribution of cases across different areas. Each ZIP code's case rate is represented by a colored bar, with colors indicating different ranges of case rates. 
§	Red Bars (Above Quartile 3): These areas represent the top 25% of case rates.
§	Orange Bars (Above Mean): These areas have case rates higher than average but not the highest.
§	Yellow Bars (Below Mean): These regions exhibit case rates lower than the average.
§	Light Green Bars (Below Quartile 1): These areas have case rates among the lowest 25%.
 
Identified ZIP Code 60604 as having an unusually high rate compared to other high-rate areas, suggesting potential outliers. Additionally, areas such as 60707 and 60827 exhibit extremely low rates, which could also be considered outliers, along with regions reporting zero rates: 60666. However, despite their identification, we have chosen not to remove these outliers from our dataset at this stage. Our decision is based on the understanding that simply identifying outliers may not provide sufficient insight without a deeper exploration of the underlying factors contributing to their occurrence. Specifically, we intend to verify the population density of regions associated with outliers before considering any data modification, incorporating additional contextual information into our analysis.

iii) Total death rates by ZIP Code – Bar Chart
Presents a breakdown of total COVID-19 death rates by ZIP code, allowing us to examine the mortality distribution across different areas. Like Figure 4, each ZIP code's rate is represented by a colored bar, with colors corresponding to various death rate ranges. By analyzing the bar chart, we can pinpoint areas experiencing high mortality rates. For instance, ZIP codes 60621, 60636, and 60649 exhibit the three highest death rates. Conversely, regions like 60661 and 60605 show remarkably low death rates, signifying successful containment efforts or a lower population susceptible to severe illness.
Another intriguing observation is that ZIP codes 60603 and 60604, despite having high case rates per 10,000 population, have zero reported weekly deaths. What could this mean? These areas might have either lower populations or a majority demographic that is less vulnerable to severe COVID-19 outcomes, or early intervention and improved treatment regimens. Additionally, the consistently zero death rate in 60666 alongside a zero-case rate outwardly suggests an extremely low or nonexistent population in this area. Our following analysis will delve into population data to confirm this judgment.

 
iv) Population by ZIP Code
Upon analyzing the results, we observe a mix of patterns in the relationship between population and COVID-19 rates across different ZIP codes, to answer our questions here's an overview on the specific characteristics of some of these prominent locations and other relevant factors:
·	ZIP Code 60629 (Population: 111,850): Located in the southwest side of Chicago, ZIP code 60629 encompasses neighborhoods such as Chicago Lawn and Marquette Park. These areas have relatively higher population densities and are characterized by diverse communities with a mix of residential and commercial establishments. The elevated case and test rates in this area can be attributed to the larger population size and potential socioeconomic factors affecting health outcomes.
·	ZIP Code 60618 (Population: 94,395): Situated on the north side of Chicago, ZIP code 60618 covers neighborhoods like Avondale and North Center. This area is known for its vibrant cultural scene, diverse population, and dense residential neighborhoods. The relatively high case and test rates may be influenced by factors such as population density, communal living arrangements, and accessibility to testing facilities.
·	ZIP Code 60632 (Population: 91,039): ZIP code 60632 is in the southwest side of Chicago and includes neighborhoods like Brighton Park and Archer Heights. These areas are densely populated with a mix of residential and industrial zones, contributing to higher COVID-19 transmission rates. Limited access to healthcare, socioeconomic disparities, and essential worker populations may also contribute to the observed trends.
·	ZIP Code 60630 (Population: 57,344): Positioned on the northwest side of Chicago, ZIP code 60630 encompasses neighborhoods like Jefferson Park and Forest Glen. Despite its smaller population size compared to other areas, the relatively high case and test rates could be influenced by factors such as proximity to major transportation hubs, communal living arrangements in multi-unit housing, and demographic characteristics of the population.
·	ZIP Codes 60602, 60603, and 60604 (Population: 1,244, 1,174, and 782, respectively): These ZIP codes cover the downtown area of Chicago, including the Loop and parts of the South Loop. Despite their low residential population counts, these areas are bustling commercial and business districts with high levels of foot traffic, tourism, and commuter activity. The elevated case and test rates may be driven by factors such as dense office spaces, public transportation hubs, and a transient population that includes tourists, commuters, and visitors.
·	ZIP Code 60666 (Population: 0): Located adjacent to O'Hare International Airport, ZIP code 60666 primarily consists of industrial and airport-related facilities. The absence of reported COVID-19 cases, test rates, and deaths could be attributed to the lack of residential population in this area, as it mainly comprises airport infrastructure, cargo facilities, and transportation logistics centers. Additionally, strict adherence to health and safety protocols within airport premises may contribute to the absence of reported cases.

 
2. Bivariate Analysis: Identifying meaningful correlations - Finding correlations using .corr()
1.	There is a strong positive correlation (0.86) between the cumulative tests and cumulative cases. This suggests that as the number of COVID-19 tests conducted increases, there is a corresponding increase in the number of known and confirmed cases.
2.	There is a strong positive correlation (0.83) between the cumulative cases and cumulative death. This indicates that as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increases, there is a corresponding increase in the number of deaths.
3.	There is a strong positive correlation (0.72) between the cumulative tests and cumulative death. This could mean that as testing efforts increase, there is a corresponding increase in the number of COVID-19-related deaths identified. It suggests that robust testing programs may lead to more accurate reporting of fatalities, aiding in the understanding of the virus's impact on public health.
Verifying the correlations: Scatter plots of variable correlations
The three visualizations individually demonstrate strong positive correlations among cumulative tests, cases, and deaths in COVID-19 data. A surge in infections can strain healthcare systems, for example, it could potentially lead to critical resource shortages like oxygen for emergency patients in hospitals, causing increased mortality rates. While the observed correlations suggest that increased testing leads to more known cases and, subsequently, more significant impacts on healthcare capacity and mortality rates, it's important to consider the broader context of the pandemic's dynamics. Factors like population, location, healthcare infrastructure and access to medical resources can significantly affect outcomes, highlighting the complex interplay of variables influencing COVID-19 transmission.
